# Data Analysis and Visualization with R Functional Form Fitting

Welcome to the Data Analysis and Visualization project using R for Functional Form Fitting! In this project, we explore and visualize data related to penguins and beer foam.

## Background

Functional form fitting is a crucial aspect of data science that involves selecting a mathematical model or function that best represents the underlying patterns in the data. In this project, we leverage functional form fitting to gain a deeper understanding of the relationships between variables.

### Part A: Penguin Data Analysis

#### 1. Download the Data
Download the dataset 'penguin.csv' from the provided link.

#### 2. Scatter Plot for Number of Penguins Over the Years
Create a scatter plot in R to depict the number of penguins in each of the given years. The corresponding R code can be found in 1OA.R in the repository.

#### 3. Correlation Analysis and Quadratic Curve Fit
- Fit a red quadratic curve across the plot to depict the correlation between the number of penguins and the years.
- Give the plot a meaningful title and name the axes appropriately.
- Identify if there is a correlation between the number of penguins and the years.

### Part B: Beer Foam Data Analysis

#### 1. Download the Data
Download the dataset 'beerfroth.csv' from the provided link.

#### 2. Scatter Plot for Beer Foam Height Over Time
Create a scatter plot in R to depict the height of beer foam against time. The corresponding R code can be found in 10B.R in the repository.

#### 3. Correlation Analysis and Exponential/Logarithmic Curve Fit
- Fit a green exponential/logarithmic curve across the plot to depict the correlation between the height of beer foam and time.
- Give the plot a meaningful title and name the axes appropriately.
- Identify if there is a correlation between beer foam height and time.
